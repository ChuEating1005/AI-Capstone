# Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms on different Gymnasium environments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate aic_project2
```
